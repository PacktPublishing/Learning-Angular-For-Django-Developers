## About the Video Course
Want to build amazing web applications using Python as a programming language? This course will enhance your skills by using Angular to build the front end and Django, a Python framework, to build the back end.
This course walks you through the complete process of both front-end and back-end development using Python and Angular. You’ll build a real-world card dealer website during the course. You’ll add features such as car components choice, homepage videos, compelling graphics, and different car models to choose from. This way, customers will get a functional and attractive web application. Finally, you’ll learn to deploy the application on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
By the end of the course, you’ll be able to combine the powers of your favorite language—Python—with Angular to provide an end-to-end web development solution.
